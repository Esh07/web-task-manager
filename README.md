# Web Task Manager

A simple web-based [task manager application](https://esh07.github.io/web-task-manager). The goal of this project is to help users in managing their daily task and organising tasks in a timely manner. In addition, the project was part of my university coursework for a module called User Interface Design and Evaluation. The course was primarily focused on project-based learning and understanding of user-centred design theories, principles, and processes.

 ## Functionality 
> Note: </br>
> In the initial implementation, a working app prototype was made using the _"T" prototype_ technique. Therefore, **only features considered high priority in the user requirement were implemented**. However, more unfinished/new features will be added to this project in the future.

The functionality that the current version of the web app has and is capable of:

1. create a task and save in the browser local storage.
2. Delete a task.
3. List down the all the available tasks from the browser’s local storage and display them on dashboard page. (Working for Work tab section only).

## Key learning

1. Web accessibility

   - Colour contrast
   - HTML semantic – the use of the proper HTML semantic element, such as the use of
     `<nav>` elements for navigation links, to make websites accessible to all users.
   - HTML validation

2. Principles and practises of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and user-centred design.

   - Three-levels of fidelity prototyping

         <details>
           <summary>Low fidelity</summary>
             <ul type="none">
               <li>Sketches and storyboards etc.</li>
             </ul>
         </details>
       </li>
       <li>
         <details>
           <summary>Medium fidelity</summary>
            <ul type="none">
               <li>Wireframes and mock-ups etc.</li>
            </ul>
         </details>
       </li>
       <li>
         <details>
           <summary> High-Fidelity – functional prototype just looks like final product.</summary>
             <ul type="disc">
               <li>“T” prototype</br></li>
                 In short, this task manager webapp is Hi-fi prototype.</ul>
         </details>
       </li>
     </ul>
   - Heuristic Evaluation of system’s design (Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristic principle)
   - Colour theory

3. HTML & CSS

   - Box Model
   - Grid
   - Flex-box
   - CSS variables and functions (custom properties)
   - Pseudo classes and pseudo elements
   - HTML semantic elements.

4. JavaScript

   - DOM manipulation with jQuery
   - CRUD operation with localStorage

## Installation

> Note: <b> A larger screen is recommended, with a minimum resolution of 1280px x 720 for a better view. </b>

This app does not require any installation to use. Follow this [link](https://esh07.github.io/web-task-manager)

## Project status

I'm still working on features that aren't finished.
